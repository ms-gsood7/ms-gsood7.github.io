        <h2>Generating Energy From Footsteps</h2>
        <p>
            To pave a sustainable future, each individual needs to realize the importance of clean energy and contribute to it. The kinetic energy can be easily converted to electrical energy with minimal infrastructure and with the power of the otherwise wasted footsteps. Wearable health monitoring technologies like pedometers, smartwatches and fitness trackers have attracted consumer interest over the years and walking 10K steps a day has become an obsession nowadays. This energy can be easily harvested and converted to green energy. This in turn benefits the individual and the planet as we continue to reduce the reliance on non-renewable sources of energy.

A UK based technology company, Pavegen has created a product which converts kinetic energy from people's footsteps into electrical power. As the company claims, each pedestrian can generate sufficient energy to light an LED bulb for 20-30 seconds [3]

Pavegen claims to be working successfully in UK, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Portugal, India, and Japan.

           Key Findings:
           In 1 hour  = 1.2 kWH of energy can be generated. This energy generation is subject to a few losses and is an indication for the potential energy that can be generated.
 
Here’s what 1 kilowatt-hour will get you:
<ul>
  <li>Spend 10 minutes in an electric shower or run one cycle in your washing machine or dishwasher.</li>
  <li>It will also take about 1 kWh to tumble dry or cook with one large ring for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>A half-hour's worth of kettle time.</li>
  <li>An average of six hours watching TV or using a computer.</li>
</ul>
